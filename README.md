# zpl-note-taker-1

## Description

  - What was my motivation? I wanted to make a Note Taker application that allows users to add and update tasks.

  - What problem does it solve? It solves the application not having a back-end in order to function.
  - What did I learn? I learned how to connect the back-end to the front end of an application.
  - What makes my project stand out? My application's readability is easy to follow for the apiRoutes.js file.
